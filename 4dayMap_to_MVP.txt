Below is a detailed 4‑day roadmap to build our MVP for DevFlow Reflector:

---

## **Day 1: Project Setup & Initial Backend Skeleton**

1. **Repository & Structure:**
   - Create or clone the repository.
   - Set up the directory structure as defined in your architecture (backend, frontend, extension placeholder, docs, etc.).
   - Run your minimal setup script (`setup.py` or `setup.sh`) to create stub files.

2. **Backend Environment:**
   - Install Python dependencies (Flask, GitPython, etc.) using `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`.
   - Verify the Python environment is working correctly.

3. **Backend Skeleton:**
   - In `backend/main.py`, write a basic Flask (or FastAPI) server that starts and responds with a "Hello World" or a simple JSON message.
   - Create stub functions in `git_parser.py`, `db_manager.py`, and `analytics.py` so that they log or return dummy data.
   - Write minimal tests in `backend/tests/test_sample.py` to verify your endpoints return the expected stub responses.

4. **Version Control:**
   - Commit all the initial directory structure and stub files.
   - Document your initial setup in your README (or a separate notes file).

---

## **Day 2: Backend Functionality & API Endpoints**

1. **Implement Core Backend Logic:**
   - **Git Parsing:**  
     In `git_parser.py`, implement a basic function to run a simple `git log` command and parse its output into a structured format (even if it’s just dummy data at first).
   - **Database Management:**  
     In `db_manager.py`, set up functions to initialize a local SQLite (or JSON-based) database and store/retrieve journal entries.
   - **Analytics Module:**  
     In `analytics.py`, create simple functions that process the dummy commit data and return some basic metrics (e.g., total commit count, commit frequency).

2. **API Endpoints:**
   - Expand your backend server (`main.py`) to include REST endpoints such as:
     - `/api/commits` – returns parsed commit data.
     - `/api/analytics` – returns computed analytics.
     - `/api/journal` – accepts and returns journal entries.
   - Ensure each endpoint returns JSON responses.

3. **Testing & Documentation:**
   - Write or update tests in `backend/tests/` to verify each endpoint.
   - Document the endpoints and expected payloads (can be added to your README or a separate API documentation file).

4. **Commit & Review:**
   - Commit your working backend code.
   - Do a manual test using tools like Postman or cURL to verify your API endpoints.

---

## **Day 3: Frontend Setup & Integration**

1. **Initialize React Application:**
   - In the `frontend` folder, verify that `package.json` is set up correctly.
   - If not already done, run `npm install` manually to install React and dependencies.
   - Ensure that `public/index.html` loads and that `src/index.js` renders the basic `<App />` component.

2. **Build Core Components:**
   - **Dashboard View:**  
     Create a simple dashboard page (`DashboardPage.js`) that fetches data from the backend endpoint (`/api/commits` or `/api/analytics`) via your `api.js` file. Use dummy data if necessary.
   - **Journal Interface:**  
     Develop a basic page (`JournalPage.js`) with a form (using the `JournalForm.js` component) where users can submit a journal entry. For now, the submission can log data or send it to the backend.
   - **Styling:**  
     Add minimal CSS in `public/assets/styles.css` to ensure a basic but clear UI layout.

3. **API Integration:**
   - In `src/api.js`, implement functions to call your backend endpoints.
   - Test the integration by rendering the dashboard with data fetched from the backend.
   - Handle errors or loading states with simple messages.

4. **Version Control:**
   - Commit your frontend changes.
   - Ensure that both backend and frontend are connected and that you can demonstrate a working, integrated application.

---

## **Day 4: Integration, Refinement, and Testing**

1. **End-to-End Integration:**
   - Perform full integration tests: start the backend server and run the frontend, verifying that all API calls work correctly.
   - Test the full flow: display commit data, calculate analytics, and submit/view journal entries.

2. **UI/UX Polishing:**
   - Refine the minimal styling of your frontend.
   - Improve layout, readability, and basic navigation (if multiple pages are used).

3. **Bug Fixes & Debugging:**
   - Run your backend tests and frontend checks to identify and fix any errors.
   - Use browser developer tools and logging in your backend to troubleshoot issues.

4. **Documentation & Final Touches:**
   - Update your README file to reflect current API endpoints and usage instructions.
   - Write brief documentation in `docs/architecture.md` summarizing your architecture and any future plans.
   - Prepare a short demo script or checklist for showcasing the MVP.

5. **Final Commit & Demo Preparation:**
   - Make a final commit with all changes.
   - Prepare to demonstrate your working MVP, ensuring you can start both backend and frontend quickly and show the core features.

This 4‑day roadmap keeps the focus on delivering a working, integrated MVP of DevFlow Reflector. Each day builds on the previous one, ensuring that by Day 4, you have a functioning application that demonstrates core functionalities: Git log visualization, basic analytics, and productivity journaling. Happy coding!
